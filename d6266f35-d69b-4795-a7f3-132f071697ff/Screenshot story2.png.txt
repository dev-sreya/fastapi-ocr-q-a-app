2. SOY.

I didn't see the frog for the rest of the day. Maybe it stayed in Miss Weaver’s hair or maybe it
jumped back through the window when I wasnt looking. All day long, I expected her to find it
and let out a scream, but she never did.

When the bell rang, I ran out of the school onto the side of the grass that had the most
bushes. I had seen frogs hide in there before, but there was no sign of any. Truthfully, I
wouldn't have known what to do with the frog if I had found it. Would I capture it? Would I
ask it questions? If I was caught talking to a frog outside the school, I think people might
finally start to remember me, but in a #donttalktothefrogkid kind of way.

I liked most of the kids in my class just fine, but I was only really close with one. His name
was Soy, and he was definitely, without a doubt, my best friend. Soy had kind of reddish-
blond hair and a round face. He and I had been friends since preschool, and I knew that I
could talk to him about anything. The downside to that was that he also felt he could talk to
me about anything. Since he had eight older brothers and two older sisters, his questions

were always about things that I didn’t understand and didn’t want to.
