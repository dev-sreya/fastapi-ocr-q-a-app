1. DAYDREAMS.

I was sitting in class when I first saw it.

Miss Weaver had been my teacher for a few months, and was known around Stagwood
Elementary for the stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head. Before the school year
started, I’d heard a few rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true.
For one thing, she did, in fact, wear the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she
always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly
boring. It was the kind of boring that made your eyes shut without permission. The biggest
problem, though, was the stories. She was obsessed with tales of former students who had
become some kind of famous. The first couple of times weren't bad, maybe even kind of
interesting. But, by the second week of school she had started repeating herself, just like her
outfits.

By then, I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who got excellent
marks in Math. The State Senator who was a teacher’s pet. I knew every word. So, instead of
trying my hardest to listen, I spent most of class drawing in my notebook.

Most days, I drew imaginary places and then spent the rest of the time whipped up

2. SOY.

I didn't see the frog for the rest of the day. Maybe it stayed in Miss Weaver’s hair or maybe it
jumped back through the window when I wasnt looking. All day long, I expected her to find it
and let out a scream, but she never did.

When the bell rang, I ran out of the school onto the side of the grass that had the most
bushes. I had seen frogs hide in there before, but there was no sign of any. Truthfully, I
wouldn't have known what to do with the frog if I had found it. Would I capture it? Would I
ask it questions? If I was caught talking to a frog outside the school, I think people might
finally start to remember me, but in a #donttalktothefrogkid kind of way.

I liked most of the kids in my class just fine, but I was only really close with one. His name
was Soy, and he was definitely, without a doubt, my best friend. Soy had kind of reddish-
blond hair and a round face. He and I had been friends since preschool, and I knew that I
could talk to him about anything. The downside to that was that he also felt he could talk to
me about anything. Since he had eight older brothers and two older sisters, his questions

were always about things that I didn’t understand and didn’t want to.
